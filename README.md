###Description

A client has approached you to make an online madlib-style game for them. They've given you the basic HTML framework, as well as an empty CSS and JS file with pseudo-code instructions on how the game should work. 


A hot, new NY Tech Startup, Relaxr, has approached you to help them develop a new landing page for their company. They've handed you the [design file](starter_code/design_file.txt) for the site, along with the copy and assets. You need to take these files and turn it into a landing page.
