###Intro

In a web development role, you might find yourself asked to perform multiple roles - such as implementation AND basic design of a web page. In cases like these, its important to be able to mock up simple interfaces that match current design standards - whether or not they're perfectly designed or not. 

Even if you don't consider yourself "artistically inclined", its important to be able to mimic basic design patterns seen in modern websites. This way, clients/users testing your code have some idea what to expect from their interaction with your work. Otherwise, your client might take bad design to mean "bad code".

For instance - 

Bad/confusing/offputting:

###Description

A client has approached you to make an online madlib-style game for them. They're most concerned with the JS functionality, but their designer is sick - so they need you to make the front end look decent enough to present the page to a board member until the final design can be hashed out. 

They've given you the basic framework, with pseudo-code detailing how they want the CSS and JS to work - get this JS working, then make sure the page follows the basic CSS guidelines. The result should be a pretty standard looking form - no designer required!

- Hook up the HTML form to the corresponding JS pseudo-code
- Style the form elements according to the descriptions in the CSS file
- On submit, the form should render the information from the form on the page
